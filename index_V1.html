                                        Our tour operates in an outdoor environment that is always changing, where there are inherent 
                                        risks and where conditions can change quickly.  The tour route can be subject to unpredictable slips, 
                                        rockfalls, rough and rugged terrain and other naturally occurring hazards.  The recent QRA report 
                                        (jointly commissioned by Hastings District Council and Dept. of Conservation) states the safest way 
                                        to experience the beach route to Cape Kidnappers is with our organised tour to ‘take advantage of 
                                        local knowledge and reduced exposure time’.<br><br>

                                        A ride with Gannet Beach Adventures can be many things – a nice day beside the sea, 
                                        an opportunity to view the amazing wildlife, or a trip back in time as told by the 
                                        layers in the coastal cliffs. Put them all together and it is a really special experience 
                                        – come and see for yourself!<br><br>
        
                                        The adult gannets are all back in full-force by the time we open each September. The chicks 
                                        start appearing from mid to late November, and they will leave the colonies at around 15-16 
                                        weeks of age. As the adults start to leave once their chick has fledged, bird numbers do get 
                                        low during the latter part of our season (late March/April).<br><br>
